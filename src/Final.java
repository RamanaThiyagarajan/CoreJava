		   In Java, the final keyword is used to denote constants and to restrict
		   inheritance and method overriding. It can be applied to variables, methods,
		   and classes.
		 
		   A final variable can only be initialized once, either via an initializer or
		   an assignment statement. Once assigned, the value of a final variable cannot
		   be changed.
